Every time she had a bowl of pasta or a slice of bread a slosh of soya sauce, her small intestine became more damaged,  less able to absorb the vitamins and minerals in her bloodstream. Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin, caused the pellagra. Didn't absorb vitamin K, caused the bleeding. And celiac is why the baby's meds didn't work. His body just couldn't absorb them.

Painful, but not deadly. But being a college-eduCated, suicidal moron, you wrapped it in gel caps or gum.  Which left no trace but burned a hole in your intestine. But the body can repair almost anything, which is cool. In your case, scar tissue closed up the hole but it also formed a bridge between a vein and an artery.  Now, veins are supposed to help the intestine flush bacteria away, but the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to the artery.  Where they got a free ride! Everywhere."
